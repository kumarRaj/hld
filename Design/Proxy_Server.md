# Proxy Server

### What is a Proxy Server?

- A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. 
- An intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse.
- Provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on need.

### How does a proxy server operate?

- Every computer on the internet needs to have a unique Internet Protocol (IP) Address. 
  Think of this IP address as your computer’s street address. Just as the post office knows 
  to deliver your mail to your street address, the internet knows how to send the correct data 
  to the correct computer by the IP address.
  A proxy server is basically a computer on the internet with its own IP address that your computer
  knows. When you send a web request, your request goes to the proxy server first. The proxy server 
  then makes your web request on your behalf, collects the response from the web server, and forwards 
  you the web page data so you can see the page in your browser.
