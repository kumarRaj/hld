# Continuous Integration

### Why should we do Continuous Integration? 

- Multiple people - code synchronization.
- Making sure that the code does not break existing things
- Sooner the code gets merged into the main branch, faster I can work on something else
- Automated tests - early feedback
- Reduce integration problems
