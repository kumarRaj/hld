# Continuous Integration

### Why should we do Continuous Integration? 

- Multiple people - code synchronization.
- Making sure that the code does not break existing things.
- Sooner the code gets merged into the main branch, faster I can work on something else.
- Automated tests - early feedback.
- Reduce integration problems.
- Available artifact at anytime.
